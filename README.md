# IST736-TextMining
Text Mining Course

This is a personal folder that contains data sets that have been part of my Syracuse Univ IST736 Text Mining course.
Items were stored here for convenience in order to make data sets available for sharing in group projects and for easy 
access for data loading in code without having to store the data in local drives.
